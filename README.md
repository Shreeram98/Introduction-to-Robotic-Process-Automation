# Introduction-to-Robotic-Process-Automation

Robotic process automation (RPA) uses the latest software technologies to automatically handle computer tasks that are highly structured, routine, and repetitive. For tasks that are largely driven by rules, schedules, or events, a robot can take the wheel and get the job done.
RPA is technology pretty sophisticated and amazing technology, in fact.
 first conducting a careful study of what those people are doing on their computers. This kind of study helps you find out which of the many desktop processes are best suited for automation. Some examples include searching, cutting and pasting, updating the same data in multiple places, moving data around, collating, and making simple choices.
 
Desktop Analytics closely monitors your employee's desktop activities and processes as they point, click, type, and navigate their way through applications and processes. It aggregates that data from all the desktops being monitored in order to prepare reports for further analysis.
Desktop Analytics uses its data-driven intelligent decisioning engine to identify processes that are the best candidates for RPA and guidance.(optimal)
You can't hand off absolutely everything to a robot, but your human team can work hand-in-hand with the robotic workforce. This is the essence of desktop automation (also known as attended automation).
Robotic automation generally refers to server-based robots designed to automate complete processes, that don't require any human judgment or intervention, in an unattended way.
You'll be pleased to know that even the process of picking ideal automation candidates has, itself, been automated to a certain extent.
 Not every human is going to respond with an immediate thumbs up.One need to keep in mind that people have been using that system for who knows how long, they've been adapting to it and making the best of it, and they've got some significant professional and even emotional investment in it.
The beauty of robotic process automation (RPA) is its ability to integrate with just about anything and everything in order to get its assigned task done. 
RPA recognizes each element by its properties and technology family, checking out its structure and hierarchy. Exactly where that element sits on the screen doesn't particularly matter to the automation.
Process recording follows the steps that a user performs and translates them into a workflow designed to replicate those actions. As such, it can make process automation fast and easy.
 As the recorder watches the user at work, for example, can it tell whether the user has paused for a specific reason or whether it's just a typical human delay?
Design-based automation creation is much more detailed, requires more planning, and may involve more people collaborating.
 It works like a charm until the developer of a particular application changes things, perhaps by removing a field that was part of an automated process, or changing its identification.
Using hard-coded timers as a condition to go from one automation step to the next is a big no-no you want to build the automations to be event-based
Another aspect to consider is what's known as exception handling. RPA works well because the robots know how to follow the rules  but of course, it's common knowledge that all rules have exceptions. A solid automation includes well-thought-out exceptional handling, so the robot knows what to do when the process doesn't follow the rules.

Humans look at the screen, recognize the elements by what they look like and howthey’re labeled, and interact accordingly.

Design-based automation creation is, to be sure, not as simple as turning on a recorder and diving in. It’s much more detailed,requires more planning, and may involve more people collaborating.
